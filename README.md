## 🖥️ Software Installation
The control software for APPI is based on [Scope Foundry]. To set up the environment:
1. Follow the [Scope Foundry installation] guidelines.
2. Download and install the [APPI code], which runs cameras, LEDs, and triggers with a dedicated [App].

📌 _Ensure all dependencies are properly installed to avoid compatibility issues._

## 📊 Data Analysis
For analyzing APPI datasets of growing plants, we recommend using the [Napari ROI Registration plugin]. This plugin is specifically designed for time-lapse registration of regions-of-interest.
