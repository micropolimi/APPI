# 3D printed material

This section is dedicated to 3D-printed equipment. Printing parameters and detailed instructions are provided to easily reproduce all the items.

## Rhizoboxes

Rhyzoboxes have been designed to allow plant growth in a classic soil mixture, while still allowing direct access and imaging of aerial tissues and the root apparatus. The design does not require any support, leaving a 45° slope useful for tilting the chamber towards the front aperture, increasing root density in the direction of the imaging surface. The used imaging surface is a 2 mm thick transparent acrylic plastic cut to fit the lateral grooves of the open side of the rhyzobox. The Arabidopsis Rhyzobox is designed so that also classical non-frosted imaging glass slides (25 x 76 mm) could be used as imaging interface and fit in the appropriate side grooves.

### Printing parameters
Nozzle: 0.4 mm
Filament color: Black matte
Filament material: PLA
Printing temperature: 190 °C
Build plate temperature: 60 °C (optional)
Layer height/Resolution: 0.1-0.3 mm
Wall thickness: 1 mm
Top/Bottom thickness: 1 mm
Infill density: 20%
Infill pattern: unimportant
Print speed: 80 mm/s
Rafts: No
Supports: No

### Printing settings
The material used is PLA due to its ease of print and accessibility, but being highly hygroscopic it could warp with time and constant watering, so other materials like PETG or ABS could be used to increase the resistance of the chamber to weathering. 
It is still important to use a black, and possibly matte, filament as it will greatly decrease background reflection under certain light sources. 
High print resolution is not fundamental but going any lower than 0.3 mm could make the internal printed surface gritty and cause abnormal root growth.
To keep a sound and possibly reusable main frame, infill of at least 20% is suggested.

Printer technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is preferable as stereolithography (SLA) uses UV-absorbent resins that have a high fluorescence to blue-shifted excitation wavelength.

## Submersion pot-holder setup
The submersion pot-holder is an adapter for magenta boxes to fit and lock in place pots subject to submersion to prevent sample floating. The design does require supports for the locking groove of the pot-holder, meaning removal of said support is necessary. The holder is designed to be glued to the bottom of a magenta box with water resistant glue.

Printer technology: For the pot-holder Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) or stereolithography (SLA) are compatible as the print will not be visible in the Field of View during acquisition. 

## Soil cover print and setup
The soil cover is designed to prevent soil spillage in the submergence solution.
The design does require supports for part of the soil cover, meaning removal of said support is necessary. 
The soil cover locks on top of classical 5 cm Ø pots around the plant main axis.

High print resolution is not fundamental but going any lower than 0.3 mm could make the internal printed surface gritty and cause abnormal root growth.
Printer technology: The soil cover will be visible in the FOV, so FDM printing technology is suggested.
For the soil cover, it is particularly important to use a black, and possibly matte, filament as it will greatly decrease background reflection under certain light sources. 

## Wounding tweezers print and setup
The wounding tweezers have been designed to apply a similar pressure on different scales of wounded surface. Wounding tweezer n° 1 has a wounding area of around 40 mm^2, n° 2 of around 160 mm^2 and n°3 of around 380 mm^2.
The design does not require supports.

## Light path barrier print and setup
The light path barrier is an easy system to reduce crasstalk between the two orthogonal pathways.
The design does require supports, meaning removal of said support is necessary.
