# 3D printed material

This section is dedicated to 3D-printed equipment. Printing parameters and detailed instructions are provided to easily reproduce all the items.

## Rhizoboxes

Rhyzoboxes are designed to support plant growth in a standard soil mixture while still providing direct access to and imaging of both aerial tissues and the root system. The design is self-supporting and features a 45° slope that tilts the chamber toward the front aperture, encouraging root growth toward the imaging surface. The imaging surface used is a 2 mm thick transparent acrylic sheet, cut to fit into the lateral grooves on the open side of the rhyzobox. The Arabidopsis rhyzobox is also compatible with standard non-frosted microscope glass slides (25 × 76 mm), which can be used as an imaging interface and fit into the corresponding side grooves.

### Printing parameters
Nozzle: 0.4 mm  
Filament color: Black matte  
Filament material: PLA  
Printing temperature: 190 °C  
Build plate temperature: 60 °C (optional)

Wall thickness: 1 mm  
Top/Bottom thickness: 1 mm  
Infill density: 20%  
Infill pattern: unimportant  
Print speed: 80 mm/s  
Rafts: No  
Supports: No  

### Printing settings
PLA is used as the primary material due to its ease of printing and wide availability. However, since PLA is highly hygroscopic, it may warp over time with constant exposure to moisture. For improved durability and resistance to weathering, alternative materials such as PETG or ABS are recommended.  
It is important to use a black, preferably matte, filament, as this significantly reduces background reflections under certain lighting conditions.  
While high print resolution is not essential, going any lower than 0.3 mm may result in a rough internal surface, which can negatively affect root development.  
To ensure a sturdy and potentially reusable main frame, an infill of at least 20% is recommended.

Printer technology: Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is preferred, as stereolithography (SLA) resins are UV-absorbent and exhibit high fluorescence under blue-shifted excitation wavelengths.

## Submersion pot-holder setup
The submersion pot-holder is an adapter for magenta boxes to fit and lock in place pots subject to submersion to prevent sample floating. The design requires support structures for printing the locking groove, which must be removed after printing. The holder is designed to be glued to the bottom of a magenta box with water-resistant glue.

Printer technology: For the pot-holder, both Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) and stereolithography (SLA) are suitable, as the printed component will not be visible within the field of view during image acquisition. 

## Soil cover print and setup
The soil cover is designed to prevent soil spillage into the submergence solution.
The design requires support structures for part of the soil cover, which must be removed after printing. 
The soil cover locks onto standard 5 cm diameter pots, securing itself around the plant’s main axis.

## Wounding tweezers print and setup
The wounding tweezers are designed to apply consistent pressure across different wound surface areas. Wounding tweezer n° 1 has a wounding area of approximately 40 mm<sup>2</sup>, n° 2 around 160 mm<sup>2</sup>, and n°3 around 380 mm<sup>2</sup>.
The design does not require support structures for printing.
