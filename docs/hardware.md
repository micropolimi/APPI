# Build your own APPI platform

This section presents a step-by-step guide to facilitate the replication of the APPI setup, using the components listed at the following [link].

### Step 1: LED, lens and filter units.

#### LED unit

Begin by taking the LED (1) and mounting the (Unknown) component onto it (2). Next, place the [LCP36] on top of the (Unknown) and insert three rods ([ER8-P4], 3). Position the rods so that only a small portion extends beyond the cage on the LED side. Using three rods instead of four will facilitate the installation of the subsequent components. Finally, mount the iris ([LCP50D]) in such a way that it remains easily accessible once the entire setup is assembled.

#### Lens unit

1) Mount the horizontal rail [XT66SD-500] on the breadboard. Be careful with the distances and position the rail in a way that you will have enough space on the breadboard to position the sampl at 45 cm from the last lens.
